# This is a study project
## I intend to make this project as my learning path to modern C# and .NET Core features
  
### The first goal is to learn how to model data into classes tha can be used over the other projects.
This will be achieved in [the Domain project]{https://github.com/mludovico/salao_marcelo_netcore/tree/master/Salao%20Marcelo.Domain}
creating classes for:
- Professional
- Client
- Timeshift
- Cashflow
- Service

### Second, learn how to use the domain as a shared library
This wil be done by creating a [simple console program]{https://github.com/mludovico/salao_marcelo_netcore/tree/master/Salao%20Marcelo.Console} to make the first interactions.
  
### Thirdly I would learn how to add the Entity Framework to the solution so it can be used after by the WebAPI
This should be accomplished in [the Data Project]{https://github.com/mludovico/salao_marcelo_netcore/tree/master/Salao%20Marcelo.Data} where will be created the repositories and mappings.
  
### Then in the fourth step I could learn how to deal with controllers of a Restful API
The [WebAPI project]{https://github.com/mludovico/salao_marcelo_netcore/tree/master/Salao%20Marcelo} will hold the controllers and all the configuration for adding dependency injection, swagger and logging support.
  
### Finally (because it is not TDD) I wish to learn a little about unit tests
Making use of NUnit I will create a [Test Project]{https://github.com/mludovico/salao_marcelo_netcore/tree/master/Salao%20Marcelo.Tests} to create my first unit test functions, just for learning purposes.
